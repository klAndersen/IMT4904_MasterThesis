# IMT4904 Master Thesis Report
LaTex repository for my Master thesis @ Gjøvik University College/ NTNU Gjøvik.

Since the thesis template is still under construction, I've added my own files in sub-folders to avoid issues during fetch. 

This way the template and example files will get updated, and changes can be added without loss of data.

The structure will be changed after the template is done (since it looks pretty messy right now).

## Directory list
* Current level: Forked files mainly
* /appendix: Files used in appendix
* /chapters: Chapters 1-n (main content in thesis)
* /figures: Forked folder
* /header: Header files (e.g. content not in main report; preface, acknowledgement, etc.)
* /src: root and build files
