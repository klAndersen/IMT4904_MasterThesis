\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to thank the following persons for their help and support during these years. It would not have been possible without them.

My supervisor, Simon McCallum, for understanding my difficult situation and for his patience and helpful advices on how to proceed so that I could complete my Master thesis.

Mariusz Nowostawski for his advice on how to get started with text processing and ideas for building the \gls{svm} model. 

Rune Hjelsvold for helpful advice in relation to text analysis.

My best friend, Nj√•l Dolonen, for always being there for me, and helped me get through this.

My grandmother, Mimmi H. Underland, may she rest in peace. None of this would have been possible without your support, understanding, love and care. This is for you.

I would also thank my family and friends for believing in me and supporting me through this.
