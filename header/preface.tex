\chapter*{Preface}
This is my Master thesis concluding the two years spent at NTNU Gj√∏vik: Master Applied Computer Science - Web, Mobile, Games track. 
The thesis was carried out during the spring semester 2016, from January to the end of May. 

The main concept for the thesis was based on discussions with supervisor. The original plan was to create a Chat Agent that could answers students questions and give feedback 
to their question quality, by using StackOverflow as a knowledge base. However, during the Master thesis project presentation, other professors noted that the scope of the 
project was to large for a Master thesis. The thesis were therefore narrowed down to focus on coding questions posted on StackOverflow, in an attempt to evaluate question quality 
and predict the future votes for a given question.
