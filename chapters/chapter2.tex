%\chapter{State of the art}
\label{chap:chapter2}
basically a summary of existing and relevant research for this thesis

\section{Text classification}
\label{sec:text_classification}
a more general introduction to text classification and the \gls{ai} techniques used \\
e.g. papers comparing systems to use as argument for why svm was chosen

\section{Question-Answering (Q/A)}
\label{sec:question_answering}
i'm thinking this needs to be split into sub-subsections or several sub-sections, mainly because I'm a bit unsure what I should put here \\
the following are some examples: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item question-answering techniques and analyses
	\item ontology and semantics
	\item StackExchange and other online communities for qa (potentially separate section)
\end{itemize}

\section{\glsentrylong{svm} (\glsentryshort{svm}), LIBSVM and Scikit-learn}
\label{sec:libsvm}
basically papers that have used (lib)svm for text classification, qa, etc
