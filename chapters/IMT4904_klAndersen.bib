  Abstract                 = {Support vector machines (SVM) have been widely used in chaotic time series predictions in recent years. In order to enhance the prediction efficiency of this method and implement it in hardware, the sigmoid kernel in SVM is drawn in a more natural way by using the fuzzy logic method proposed in this paper. This method provides easy hardware implementation and straightforward interpretability. Experiments on two typical chaotic time series predictions have been carried out and the obtained results show that the average CPU time can be reduced significantly at the cost of a small decrease in prediction accuracy, which is favourable for the hardware implementation for chaotic time series prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {The process of hypothesis testing entails both information selection (asking questions) and information use (drawing inferences from the answers to those questions). We demonstrate that although subjects may be sensitive to diagnosticity in choosing which questions to ask, they are insufficiently sensitive to the fact that different answers to the- same question can have very different diagnosticities. This can lead subjects to overestimate or underestimate the information in the answers they receive. This phenomenon is demonstrated in two experiments using different kinds of inferences (category membership of individuals and composition of sampled populations). In combination with certain information-gathering tendencies, demonstrated in a third experiment, insensitivity to answer diagnosticity can contribute to a tendency toward preservation of the initial hypothesis. Results such as these illustrate the importance of viewing hypothesistesting behavior as an interactive, multistage process that includes selecting questions, interpreting data, and drawing inferences.},
